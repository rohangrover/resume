I'm a doctoral student at the [Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism](https://annenberg.usc.edu/) at USC.

I study how digital technologies shape civic engagement and political activism, especially transnationally. I explore this topic at the intersection of online politics, digital platforms and infrastructures, and social movements by drawing from multiple traditions such as critical race studies, political economy, and STS. My research has been supported by [NYU MCC](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/mcc/), the [A/P/A Institute](https://apa.nyu.edu/), the [Membership Puzzle Project](https://membershippuzzle.org/), and [APSA](https://www.apsanet.org/).

I have a Master of Arts in Media, Culture, and Communication from NYU and a Bachelor of Science in Economics, with a minor in Asian American Studies, from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Before beginning my PhD, I [worked as a product manager, data analyst, and digital strategist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grohanver/) in progressive digital media and advocacy organizations such as MoveOn, HuffPost, Upworthy, and Planned Parenthood.

I am available for research, data, and product consulting or contracts through my consultancy,Â [N+R Insights](https://www.nrinsights.com/).
